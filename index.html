            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Greece has played a fundamental role in shaping the modern world. As the birthplace of democracy, philosophy, and the Olympic Games, its influence can still be felt today. The ancient city-states of Athens and Sparta were central to the development of political and military power, while Greek philosophers such as <mark>Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle</mark> laid the foundation for Western thought. The vast empire of Alexander the Great spread Greek culture and ideas far beyond its borders, leaving a lasting impact on history.</p>
