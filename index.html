            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Greece has played a fundamental role in shaping the modern world. As the birthplace of democracy, philosophy, and the Olympic Games, its influence can still be felt today. The ancient city-states of Athens and Sparta were central to the development of political and military power, while Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle laid the foundation for Western thought. The vast empire of Alexander the Great spread Greek culture and ideas far beyond its borders, leaving a lasting impact on history.</p>
